Portfolio Optimization

This code was part of my contribution to the student funds of our university during my tenor of being the fund manager of the "ESG Millenium Fund".
I am more than grateful that I had the oportunity to lead a team of 5 eager analysts and to equip them with fundamental knowledge of analysing stocks and how to pitch them.
Only with their help we were able to outperform our selected benchmark significantly.

My special thanks go out to those who made the Investment Club possible.
